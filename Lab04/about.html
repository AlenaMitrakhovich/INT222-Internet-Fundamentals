		<h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site. My name is Alena and I am a Computer Programming student at Seneca College. You may
		be wondering how and why I chose this path and here is a short summary of how I got here.</p>
		<p>I began my post-secondary education at York University where I completed a 4 year degree in Business from which I graduated
		in 2013. Post graduation, I found a full-time job with Randstad Canada as a Resource Manager. Essentially, I was a recruiter/head-hunter
		specializing in the IT industry. I worked with many companies and placed many IT professionals in many different roles. Although I enjoyed
		this position, I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that was more challenging and interesting. Through many conversations over a 2 year
		span with my clients, I came to the decision that I wanted to become a Computer Programmer myself. Hence, after 2 years with Randstad,
		I resigned and came back to school to learn Computer Programming.</p>
		<p>Stay stuned as I make progress and continue updating this website as I learn more and become a more capable UI developer :)</p>
